# Jack's Assetto Tools
This repository is for me to remember how I configured my Assetto Corsa (AC) Ubuntu server running on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and to not lose the precious, precious scripts I wrote to automate it. 

**Targeted Workflow:** I host a weekly race night at the [League of Perpetual Novices](https://discord.me/LoPeN), which has a practice server open 24/7 and car reservation via a simple [Google Sheet](https://www.google.ca/sheets/about/). The server is run in "pickup" mode, meaning people who don't sign up can (and do!) hop in at any time. Combined with how busy I am, I want the following:
 1. A few-click method for me to automatically: 
    * upload the minimum required files to the AC server
    * reconfigure and restart the server
    * set up the reservations sheet
    * inform everyone about the event on [our Discord server](https://discord.me/LoPeN).
 2. A simple-to-configure bot that monitors the server, sending Discord messages with lap times and who is on the server
 3. Scripts to stop/start the server, send automated messages to discord, etc.

**To be included here:**
 * Some basic information about remote dedicated servers
 * Instructions for setting up a remote Ubuntu server
 * Instructions for setting up a google reservations sheet (vanilla AC) or server manager
 * Information about how to use the scripts
