# Jack's Assetto Tools
This repository is to explain how to set up an Assetto Corsa Ubuntu server, and how to use some of the scripts I wrote to automate it. 

**Targeted Workflow:** I host a weekly race night at the [League of Perpetual Novices](https://discord.me/LoPeN), which has a practice server open 24/7, a reservation sheet with custom liveries, and a server that runs in "hybrid" mode where people who don't sign up can hop in at any time. Combined with how busy and distracted I am, I need the following:
 1. A few-click method for me to automatically reconfigure the server for next week's race
 2. A simple Discord bot that monitors the server, sending messages with lap times and who is currently racing. No API nonsense, just webhooks.
 3. Scripts to stop/start the server, send automated messages to discord, etc.
